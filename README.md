- My name is Mike Belyayev github:(@Belyayev)
- I’m interested in problem solving with code and working on creative projects.
- I love graphics and stunning visuals of all sorts. 3D, Web/Desktop UI, XR/VR and more. In my work I try to fuse art and science together, which is beautiful graphics with functional code.
